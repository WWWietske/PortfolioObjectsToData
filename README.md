# From objects to data portfolio

This portfolio contains the datasets, scripts and proposals used for our research and the visualisation and report of our research.

My contributions to the project are in the scripts folder. I created the scripts we used for refining our data and the visualisation. The visualisation folder contains the html files that were made using the script visualise.R.
